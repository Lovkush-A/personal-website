This is a linkpost to my [substack post](https://lovkush.substack.com/p/books-i-read-in-nov-and-dec-2024) reviewing several books including Pachinko, Star Maker, The Old Drift, and others. The post covers a diverse range of genres from multi-generational family sagas to science fiction and mathematical theory, with recommendations and brief critiques for each book.
