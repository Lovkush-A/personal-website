This is a linkpost to my [LessWrong post](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/PvDNm2NZDyRdG9fCh/liron-shapira-vs-ken-stanley-on-doom-debates-a-review) reviewing the discussion between Liron Shapira and Ken Stanley on the Doom Debates podcast. The review covers their key disagreements about the nature of superintelligence, particularly around optimization versus open-endedness.
