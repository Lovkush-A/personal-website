This is a linkpost to my [substack post](https://lovkush.substack.com/p/i-tried-anthropics-computer-use-agent) describing my experience testing Anthropic's new computer-use capability for Claude. The post covers both my hands-on testing of the feature with a simple restaurant search task, and how a roleplay exercise changed my perspective on Anthropic's decision to release this technology at an early stage.
