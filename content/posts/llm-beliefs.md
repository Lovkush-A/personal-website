This is a linkpost to a summary of a 2-hour discussion I had with [Max Heitmann](https://www.linkedin.com/in/max-heitmann-224440249/), a co-founder of Aether, and [Miles Kodama](https://www.mkodama.org/) about whether [large language models (LLMs) or LLM agents have beliefs](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/HvTcWmHnpXnTpC3yJ/scattered-thoughts-on-what-it-means-for-an-llm-to-believe) and the relevance of this to AI safety.
