This is a linkpost to my [substack post](https://lovkush.substack.com/p/ai-as-a-powerful-meme) or [LessWrong post](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/PSL88nJjMghpMNTfe/ai-as-a-powerful-meme-via-cgp-grey).

The one-line summary: AI should not be compared to nuclear weapons but instead to biological weapons or memes, which evolve under the implicit evolutionary pressures that exist, leading to AI's that are good at surviving and replicating.
