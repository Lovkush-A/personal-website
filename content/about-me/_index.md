I am an aspiring AI Safety Researcher, having previously been a mathematician, lecturer and data scientist.

Currently I am upskilling while also doing fieldbuilding with two organisations:
- [ML4Good](https://www.ml4good.org/). I lead the most recent camp, and will continue to iterate and lead future camps.
- [BlueDot](https://bluedot.org/). I am a teaching fellow for the final cohort of 2024, which means that I will be facilitating weekly discussion for several groups and providing constructive feedback for how to improve the course.

For further details on my background:
