### Learning

I enjoy learning about pretty much anything.
To get a flavour of what interests me, I recommend you read [52 Things I Learnt in 2020](https://lovkush.medium.com/52-things-i-learnt-in-2020-86b04c0ea194), [in 2023](https://lovkush.substack.com/p/things-i-learnt-in-2023) and [in 2024](https://lovkush.substack.com/p/52-things-i-learnt-in-2024).

In particular, I enjoy learning how to learn. Some big tips:

- Use a spaced repetition system to memorise whatever you want. I use [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).
- Use a note-taking app. I use [Dynalist](https://dynalist.io/).
- Push the speed at which you read or listen to the maximum. I now find myself listening to things at 3x speed.

### Effective Altruism

Simply put, effective altruism is all about trying to make the most of your altruism.
For a good introduction and broad overview, I recommend [this introduction](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/introduction-to-effective-altruism/).

In late 2014, I took the [Giving What We Can Pledge](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge/), in which I commit to donating 10% of my income for the rest of my life to particularly good charities.

I really urge you to spend a couple of hours reading around this.
This is not just some academic exercise - a small change in your actions could greatly improve thousands of people's lives.
And if you're having some kind of doubts or skepticism, that's good!
This is an important decision and I am happy to have a chat if you're interested.
